Demonstration of Compose Multiplatform with KTOR Client.

Simple demo to GET information about cats using KTOR Client from "https://catfact.ninja/fact"

Inspired by Philipp Lackner's excellent Video tutorial on 'HTTP Requests in Kotlin Multiplatform With Ktor - KMP for Beginners'

Note used Compose Multiplatform wizard https://terrakok.github.io/Compose-Multiplatform-Wizard/

Selected Android, Desktop and Browser (WASM) as not seen any examples of Browser client so wanted to give it a go.

As per README.MD added local.properties, adjusted libs.versions.toml and build.gradle.kts to include missing dependency.

Added bare-bones code to test GET for android app, desktop and browser.
